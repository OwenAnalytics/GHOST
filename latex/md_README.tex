G\-H\-O\-S\-T (General meta-\/\-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++11 library designed for Star\-Craft\-: Brood war, under the terms of the G\-N\-U G\-P\-L v3 licence. G\-H\-O\-S\-T implements a meta-\/heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of combinatorial and optimization R\-T\-S-\/related problems represented by a C\-S\-P. It is an generalization of the Wall-\/in project (see \href{https://github.com/richoux/Wall-in}{\tt github.\-com/richoux/\-Wall-\/in}).
