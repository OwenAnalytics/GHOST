/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ library 
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem 
 * solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of 
 * combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP. 
 *
 * GHOST has been first developped to help making AI for the RTS game
 * StarCraft: Brood war, but can be used for any kind of applications where 
 * solving combinatorial and optimization problems within some tenth of 
 * milliseconds is needed. It is a generalization of the Wall-in project.
 * Please visit https://github.com/richoux/GHOST for further information.

   * You just need to instanciate one Solver object.
   *
   * The Solver class is a template class, waiting for both the type
   * of variable, the type of domain and the type of constraint. Thus,
   * you must instanciate a solver by specifying the class of your
   * variable objects, the class of your domain object and the class
   * of your constraint objects, like for instance Solver<Variable,
   * Domain, Constraint> or Solver<MyCustomVariable, MyCustomDomain,
   * MyCustomConstraint>, if MyCustomVariable inherits from the
   * ghost::Variable class, MyCustomDomain inherits from the
   * ghost::Domain class and MyCustomConstraint inherits from the
   * ghost::Constraint class.
   *
   * Solver's constructor also need a shared pointer of an Objective
   * object (nullptr by default). The reason why Objective is not a
   * template parameter of Solver but a pointer is to allow a dynamic
   * modification of the objective function.
