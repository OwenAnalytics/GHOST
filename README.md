GHOST
=====

GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++11 library designed for StarCraft: Brood war, under the terms of the GNU GPL v3 licence.  GHOST implements a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of combinatorial and optimization RTS-related problems represented by a CSP.  It is an generalization of the Wall-in project (see [github.com/richoux/Wall-in](https://github.com/richoux/Wall-in)).
