Please be sure to have CMake v3.0+ and a C++14-capable compiler.

============
On GNU/Linux:

You have options 1, 2 or 3.

1. To compile and install the release version:
$> make

2. To compile and install the debug version:
$> make debug

3. If you just want to compile, without installing the library on your /usr/local, then you have two choices:
To compile in release mode:
$> mkdir release
$> cd release
$> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$> make

To compile in debug mode:
$> mkdir debug
$> cd debug
$> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
$> make

And finally, if you change your mind and want to install the library:
$> sudo make install
(in the release or debug folder)

Troubleshooting:

Got the error 'The compiler /usr/bin/c++ has no C++14 support. Please use a different C++ compiler.'?
1. Make sure you have installed a C++14-capable compiler
2. If you have such a compiler but still get the error, before typing the command  'cmake ..', type 'export CXX=/path/of/your/c++14/compiler/executable_name'
